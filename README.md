Coombs et al., 2019, Nat Commun, 10:5166

Each parameter is calculated using a different script. For example, the script 
calc_speed_costh calculates the speed vs cosine theta.

Each script runs the data from all experiments for each condition at once. The 
first input variable needed is the number of experiments. This number is 
associated with the number of Microsoft(R) Excel files (generated by Imaris(R) 
software in our case). If a different format of Microsoft(R) Excel file is 
given, then the user should modify the functions 'read_xls_file.m' and 
'read_xls_file_vector.m'.

Each script reads a data function (e.g. cell_data.m) which includes the 
properties of the experiments of each condition, e.g. a) the name of the excel 
files, b) the pixel size, c) the time post-wounding that imaging started, 
d) the wound perimeter. These data functions should be in the same folder as 
the scripts.

To run a script, click 'Run', assuming Microsoft(R) Excel files and data 
functions have been generated. To run a different condition, the user should 
change the number of experiments, the data function name, the source data 
folder and the output file name. In all scripts, these are denoted with a (*).

For each script, an example data function is provided. Additionally, an 
example of source data is provided for calculation of kinetics and cluster 
size.
